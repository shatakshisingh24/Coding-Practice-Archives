Iterators are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers. They are primarily used in a sequence of numbers, characters etc. We can use iterators to move through the contents of the container. They can be visualised as something similar to a pointer pointing to some location and we can access content at that particular location using them.

Basic Operations of iterators :-
begin() :- This function is used to return the beginning position of the container.
end() :- This function is used to return the after end position of the container.
advance() :- This function is used to increment the iterator position till the specified number mentioned in its arguments.
next() :- This function returns the new iterator that the iterator would point after advancing the positions mentioned in its arguments.
prev() :- This function returns the new iterator that the iterator would point after decrementing the positions mentioned in its arguments.
inserter() :- This function is used to insert the elements at any position in the container. It accepts 2 arguments, the container and iterator to position where the elements have to be inserted.
